# video_game_data
This was part of my "Hackathon" assignment where we were assignned to  choose a topic of interest and analyse whatever data we found on the internet. As explained in my reaction time and priming repository a series of unfortunate events led to the absence of my original R script. However, I was able to recover the markdown file which was submitted to my university's submission site. 

I love video games so this was a natural choice. I wanted to gain some insights into one of my favourite hobbies. I believe I achieved this, however it is clear upon revisiting my work that the graphs created using ggplot could have used some work. This was created when I first started using R for data analysis and some of the graphs used were not appropriate for displaying the data. However, I believe it is still somewhat understandable.

Again, I have uploaded this for my nostalgic purposes and if you have any interest in it feel free to take a look. The markdown documents do not diplsay the graphs on GitHub so I have attatched a word Document displaying the R code and the graphs.
